  name: Systems biology modelling
  description: >
    LEcture on the modelisation of biological systems. Not a classical lecture, but project driven. Students are asked to learn about a model of their choice and use it to do some basic simulations. We also ask them to go on Twitter to learn to communicate about complex biological issues (in this case modelling). In 2017, the course lead to a blog post on Botany One.
