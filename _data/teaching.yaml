  name: Introduction to plant biology [LBIR1151]
  description: >
    Lecture about plant organography, morphology and anatomy, give to first year bachelor student of the [Faculty of bioscience engineering](http://www.uclouvain.be/agro) at UCLouvain. With this lecture, we try to include new teaching techniques, such as [student peer-assesement](https://www.d-pac.be/), [virtual microscope](https://cytomine.uclouvain.be), conceptual maps or large scale treasure hunt of biological structures.

  name: Integrative biology [LBIR1353]
  description: >
    The integrative biology lecture focuses on mecanismes used by the plant to cope with changing (and challenging) environments. One specificity of the lecture is that it heavily rely on the use of [functional-structural plant models](https://plantmodelling.shinyapps.io/PlaNet_Maize/).

  name: Soil-Root interactions [LBRES2106]
  description: >
    Lecture on soil-root interactions given a the [UCLouvain](http://www.uclouvain.be), to master students of the [Faculty of bioscience engineering](http://www.uclouvain.be/agro). Covering, among other thing, hydrotropisms, branching, hydropatterning and soil retention curves.

  name: Systems biology modelling [LBRAI2219]
  description: >
    Lecture on biological systems modelling. Not a classical lecture, but project-driven. Students are asked to learn about a plant model and use it to answer a research question. We also ask them to go on Twitter to learn to communicate about complex biological issues (in this case modelling). In 2017, the course lead to a blog post on [Botany One](https://www.botany.one/2018/02/hard-use-plant-computational-models-ask-students/).

  name: BotAlgorithme
  description: >
    BotAlgorithme is a teaching project that aims a gathering plant models that can be used to teach plant biology. Models should be usable online and based on sound biology. We use the different models in the classroom, to add quantitative twist to our plant biology classes.
