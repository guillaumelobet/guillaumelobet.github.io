  title: This is my list of failures. Being a scientist is not always easy and sometimes (often?) what you try does not work, for various reasons. But your failures are, at least, as important as your successes, as they make you think harder about yourself and your work! So, I decided to be proud of them!</br></br>The list below is still short, but I am confident it will flourish with time. </br></br>It might be worth mentionning my most recent meta-failure : the fact that I post failures here cost me a participation in a research consortium... </br></br>Full disclosure, the idea is not from me and you can read more <a href="http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7322-467a">about it here</a>.
