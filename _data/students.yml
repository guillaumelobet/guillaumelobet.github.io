  description: >
    Remy's work aims at understanding how environmental stresses affect plant physiology and identifying innovative traits that allow adapted crops/genotypes to improve their tolerance strategies and to maintain an economically viable yield under stress conditions. He defines himself as a plant physiologist who examines the bases of exceptional stress tolerance through the investigation of underlying physiological mechanisms.

    Mona is a PhD student working on a BMBF-funded project entitled "Rhizo4Bio (Phase 1): CROP - Combination of Complementary Root Phenotypes for More Resistant Agroecosystems". She is very enthousiastic about the modelling of wheat whole plant growth, water and carbon fluxes within the plant, and root-soil interactions.

  description: >
    Xiaoran is a PhD student at the Forschungszentrum Jülich. His previous experiences are based on studying his major, Viticulture and Enology, with modeling and web applications. His interest is to develop a mechanistic plant model (CPlantBox)that traces carbon and water movement in maize by explicit coupling of xylem and phloem fluxes.

    Adrien is a PhD student at the UCLouvain. He is deeply interest "in silico" plants and ways to grow a more suistanable  agriculture. Adrien now works as a post-doc researcher in the lab of Mathieu Javaux. We were very sad (but also happy) to see him leave the nest.
