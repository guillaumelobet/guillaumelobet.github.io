    - The [TapRoot podcast](https://plantae.org/taproot-s2e1-phenotyping-roots-without-pulling-up-your-own-with-guillaume-lobet/), where I talk about root phenotyping & resisting the mandate to move repeatedly for training.

    - The [School of Batman](https://soundcloud.com/schoolofbatman/the-case-of-the-fading-frosts-of-tibet-guillaume-lobet), where I discuss about plant modelling and how it could help Batman fight crime.
